Within the Chain object structure:

NFP - number of forward params
objstruc - state of the current chain (sd of data can be treated as hhyperparams)
DobsR(V) - observed data
Dres - residuals

Global variables:
sample - posterior sample

ieee_arithmetic library - for NA / NaN

Objstruc objm - container for swapping

ExploreMH - for hierarchical samples
ExploreMH_NOVARPAR - simple TransD, complexity of layer parametrization does not change -- My case;

Carry out MH sweep , no b/d
Do not use EXploreMH_VARPAR!!
 
Compile the code with adjustments in structure

call(dispersion) under likelihood function is where the forward model comes in
SWD -> ttimes

Drop the non-obvious functions into different source files to simplify things

Hard wire kmin / kmax for a fixed D problem (equal to number of layers !)
in makefile:

libswd -> my ray tracing codes
Makefile.compiler - set the compilers to gfortran or pgfortran.
comment out linear algebra packages
